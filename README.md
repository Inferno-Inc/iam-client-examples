# Identity and Access Management (IAM) Client Examples

This repository contains client examples which leverage the [iam-client-lib](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/iam-client-lib) and communicate with a [hosted backend](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/passport-did-auth/tree/develop/examples/server/express) to authenticate and authorize a user using DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials).
